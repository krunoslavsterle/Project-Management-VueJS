# Project Management Frontend in Vue.js

This is a frontend SPA application I have created as part of my learning process of the Vue.js framework. The idea for the application came from one of my older projects called [Project Management](https://github.com/krunoslavsterle/Project-Management) created with ASP.NET MVC framework. I have decided to use the already available design and just create a frontend SPA application.

## Backend
The application is not connected with the backend, I created a service with mocked data and use that instead. 

## Built With
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex)
* [Vue Router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router)

## Setup project
Run these commands:  
`npm install`  
`npm run dev`
